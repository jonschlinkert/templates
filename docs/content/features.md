## Why use Assemble?

- **Lightning fast.** Generate a site with thousands of pages in a few seconds.
- **Cross-platform.**
- **Easy to use.**
- **Extremely powerful.** Most static site generators are locked into a single template engine, or conventions for how source files are organized, or how destination files are generated. Assemble ships with sensible defaults, so you can hit the ground running, but you can use any template engine, front-matter parser, content format or data provider you want.
